# Earthbound Saves

![EB Banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14339974/169930737-dbf7da7a-f432-449e-a7a3-eee6432fe630.png)

This repository is for sharing save files for Earthbound, so the same file can be played across multiple devices.

**__IMPORTANT:__**  Make sure your rom name matches the name of the `.srm ` file in the repo **__exactly__**, or the save won't be detected when the game is run.


### Downloading Saves

After pulling the latest changes to your local repo, open snes9x and identify in your configuration where game save files are located:
1. Select **Emulation -> Settings** 
2. In the menu that opens, change the left dropdown to **saves** and note the filepath:
![snes9x save location](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14339974/169931319-44f547d7-123e-49b3-8bc2-6294e36afee0.png)

Once the appropriate location has been identified, delete any existing earthbound-related save files and copy `Earthbound.srm` into the folder.

You can also copy the contents of the `SNES9x states` folder into your configured location for save states if you wish to load from save states.

Start Snes9x and load up your game!


### Uploading Saves

When you are ready to push your progress to remote, locate Snes9x's configured save location following the steps above, and copy all relevant files into your local repo folder.

Have fun!
